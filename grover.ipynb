            "When its price came crashing down to earth in early July, Bitcoin had on many a Monday easily the most heavily coveted stock in tech. A mere 300 shares, sitting at the peak for a cryptocurrency in January, traded for at least $5,845. Traders’ enthusiasm quickly dissipated when it dipped below $30.\n",
            "As it is, Bitcoin traded well below $30 and it’s still a taker. On Monday, it tumbled to around $25. This is below its six-year peak of just $20,510. Nonetheless, it’s still not far from an extreme bubble.\n",
            "The drop in cryptocurrency market values will probably have been the lowest that Bitcoin has traded in the past several years. Much of the decline was due to a pair of sell-offs in the first half of 2018. The next two months have been especially awful.\n",
            "The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite all suffered large declines. The five biggest losses were almost identical to the other four major indexes during that period.\n",
            "The collapse in cryptocurrency market values is not unprecedented. During 2008, for example, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost just 12 percent of its value, compared to a tenfold drop. That trend will continue in the coming years.\n",
            "Bitcoins are the more mainstream cryptocurrency, but they represent a new form of monetary policy where all kinds of capital invest in new kinds of currencies. The most popular category of products and companies are Bitcoins, but that market is at a historic low. Bitcoins will be seen as a replacement for gold, and if you take into account Bitcoin’s current low value of $3,980, the average age for retail users remains 28.65 years.\n",
            "Thus, a few years down the road, Bitcoin could find another life. Perhaps the move to regulate the digital currency would provide some comfort for large miners that see Bitcoin as a fundamentally valuable asset.\n",
            "“As for Bitcoin, its current values mean it might not find its own niche. It doesn’t have the appeal of a typical ‘crypto’ in an otherwise safe environment. Right now, however, that doesn’t mean it can’t develop a strong foundation for growth,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago.\n",
